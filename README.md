In this project, a database regarding Food Delivery on Campus is provided to us. Understand a test database for a campus-controlled food delivery service similar to craveoncampus.com. Based on this database, we are going to generate rating tables for restaurants and drivers. Our rating tables will be sorted by high to low rating or low to high rating (5 is the highest and 1 is the lowest).
